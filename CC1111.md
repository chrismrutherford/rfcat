# CC1111 #

The CC1111 is a system on chip from Texas Instruments with integrated wireless capability.  There are three types available at the following frequencies:
  * 300 - 348MHz
  * 391 - 464MHz
  * 782 - 928MHz

Texas Instruments currently holds two product where the CC1111 is included on, these are the Chronos kit and the CC1111 evaluation kit module.

The Chronos kit is a timing system from Texas Instruments intended for application development but the wireless dongle included holds the CC1111 chip and can be used with our project.

The CC1111 evaluation kit module on the other hand is intended for creating firmware for the CC1111, this dongle includes two pin headers for testing and programming.

Peripherals of the CC1111 are:
  * 8051 core
  * RF
  * DMA
  * USB and Serial interface
  * Timers
  * ADC

Features of the RF part are:
  * Different types of modulation
  * Variable and fixed length packets
  * Continuous receiving and transmitting modes
  * Adjustable data rate
  * Sync word detection
  * Address filtering
  * Forward error correction
  * Automatic recalibration
  * Data whitening
  * Append status bytes
  * Append CRC checksum
  * Adjustable output power
