# Contributing #

Everybody is free to contribute to the project. Contributing can be done in several ways:
  * Testing the firmware

This is the most easy way of contributing, just check out the latest version from the repository and use the application in the way you want, most bugs are found when a program is used on a manner the creator didn't expected, if a bug is found it can be added to the issue list.

  * Work on the documentation
Documentation can always do better, we are trying to put as much on the Wiki to make stuff as clear as possible but there is always room for improvement, if you think important subject aren't covered you are free to update the Wiki pages.

  * Fix bugs
Sending in patches in order to fix a bug that is known or found is very much appreciated.

  * Write code for the firmware
Currently there is a TODO list of things that we would like to see working, if you would like to join the team and help working on these items please contact us.
